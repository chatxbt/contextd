# Using contextd with Redis

[contextd](https://github.com/contextualized/contextd) is a Python library for managing context data in applications. It provides a simple and flexible way to store and retrieve context-specific data, such as user preferences, session information, or application state.

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use `contextd` with Redis as the backend store for storing and retrieving context data.

## Prerequisites

Before running this example, make sure you have the following:

- A Redis server running (either locally or on a remote server)
- The Redis Python client library installed (`pip install redis`)

## Example Code

```python
import contextd
from redis import Redis

# Connect to Redis
redis_client = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Create a context manager with Redis as the backend store
context_manager = contextd.ContextManager(backend='redis', backend_options={'client': redis_client})

# Use the context manager as you would normally
with context_manager.start_context('my_context') as ctx:
    ctx.set('key1', 'value1')
    ctx.set('key2', 'value2')

    # Retrieve values from the context
    value1 = ctx.get('key1')
    value2 = ctx.get('key2')
    print(f'Value1: {value1}, Value2: {value2}')

# The context data is now stored in Redis
```

## Explanation

1. We import the necessary modules: `contextd` for the context management library and `redis` for the Redis client.
2. We connect to a Redis server (in this case, running locally on the default port).
3. We create a `ContextManager` instance with `'redis'` as the backend and pass the Redis client as the `backend_options`.
4. We start a new context named `'my_context'` using the `start_context` method.
5. Within the context, we set two key-value pairs using the `set` method.
6. We retrieve the values of the keys using the `get` method and print them.
7. When the context manager exits (either by reaching the end of the `with` block or due to an exception), the context data is automatically stored in Redis.

## Usage

To run this example, make sure you have a Redis server running and the `redis` Python library installed. You can install it using `pip install redis`.

Update the Redis connection details (host, port, etc.) in the code to match your Redis server configuration.

This example demonstrates how `contextd` can be used with Redis as the backend store for storing and retrieving context data. By leveraging Redis, you can easily share context data across multiple processes or machines, making it suitable for distributed applications or microservices architectures.
